Data on online store sales are given. The data is presented as json files and they are in ./data
Based on these data, you need to build a predictive model that will predict the total profit of the store for 30 days, starting from the current date.
The same must be done separately for the top 10 countries with the highest income. 
What the data looks like can be seen in jupyter notebook ./notebooks/proj.ipynb
